# GB_LZ_1373_Transplantation_of_V2as_Manuscript
Code for analysis of single-cell/nuclei RNA-seq data in the Transplantation of V2as Manuscript (with Lana Zholudeva et al.) 

## Researchers
- Lana Zholudeva
- Ayushi Agrawal

## Experimental details
- 10X single cell RNA-seq experiment and single nucleus RNA-seq experiment
- There are 8 samples in this experiment:
    - 4 Samples: Injured female Sprague Dawley Rat Cervical 3/4 spinal cord injury with human V2a Spinal interneurons, traced with PRV614(RFP) 2 months post-transplantation
    - 1 Sample: Injured female Sprague Dawley Rat Cervical 3/4 spinal cord injury with human V2a Spinal interneurons 2 months post-transplantation. NO PRV and different batch of cells
    - 2 Samples: single cell sample of cells the same batch as the original single cell dataset. These are the cells prior to transplantation
- All samples 3-8 would be aligned to human genome with PRV and RFP and ChR2 sequences added in. 
- Metadata information:
